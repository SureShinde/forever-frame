                <h3 class="block-title">Can I swap out the photo without disturbing the sand?</h3>
                <div class="block-content">
                    <p>ABSOLUTELY YES. We had that in mind while we were developing this frame. You can <a href="http://www.foreverframe.com/instructions.html">change the picture</a> the day after the ceremony or 5 years later. The sand will be the same.</p>

                <h3 class="block-title">What is the difference between the Forever Frame and the Forever Framette?</h3>
                <div class="block-content">
                    <p>The only difference is the size. The Forever Framette is just a smaller, compact version of the Forever Frame. It has all the same features, functions and colors in a smaller size. It takes 1 total cup of sand to fill to the Keeper Plate.</p>

                    <p>YES. The removable glass photo pane allows the photo to be in front of the sand or behind. It is your choice.</p>
